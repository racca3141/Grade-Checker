# Grade-Checker

Lab 4d: Grade Checker

Write a function that returns a boolean true or false based on whether or not an integer is in the range 89 < x <=100.

The function prototype will look like this:

bool checkForA(int x);
1. In the main, tell the user what the app does.
2. Get the grade value of x from the user.
3. Pass the users integer to the function. Use logic to determine if the grade is an A or not. Return true or false.
4. In the main, use the function result to display the results to the user as follows:

You have earned an A.
or

You have not earned an A.
